  About Data:
  Data taken from official agro data using ftp to access it and it's life real world data

  Steps to open github file:-
  1. Download the zip file and unzip it
  2. open project in vs code or go to vs code go to option  file  search for  open folder and click desired folder which contain project file
  3. open terminal and delete venv file  and also see in file folder if having otherwise no need for modification
  4. write command - "python -m venv venv"
  5. Wait for some time once done write next command "venv/Scripts/activate"
  6. then install required dir "pip install -r requirements.txt"
  7. Then done just write last command "streamlit run app.py"
  8. Congrats! it's Done your project is live in your local enviroment (if not seen just open broser i.e already open)
